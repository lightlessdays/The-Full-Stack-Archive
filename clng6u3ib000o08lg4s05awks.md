*Please note: this article is a culmination of thousands of free, open source articles on the internet.*

So, hello people. Today we have a very out-of-the-blue topic for our blog. How to operate a mixer for live sound. Hmm...

Let’s first take a look at the different sections of this mixer. Dividing the mixer into sections, you’ll find that it isn’t nearly as complicated as it looks.

Either on the top or the rear panel of the console, you’ll find the inputs and outputs. This is where you connect input devices (such as microphones) and output devices (such as speakers).

On the left/right portion of the console, you’ll see a bank of channel strips.

Each vertical column of knobs, buttons, and faders represents an individual input channel. That set of controls simply repeats itself again and again for each input.

You can see that this console has 10 mono mic/line level input channels and 2 stereo line level input channels.

On the right part of the console, you’ll find the master sections. This gives us basic control over each of our outputs:

1. Master Fader
    
2. Group Faders
    
3. Aux Master Knobs
    
4. Matrix Master Knobs
    

Now let us see how to set up the mixer.

## Setting up the Mixer

#### Step One: Connect the Main Speakers

The Main loudspeakers *(*mains for short*)* are the primary speakers used to amplify your mix to the audience. The mains consist of two speakers, one stage left and the other right. If you don’t need both, just connect one, but know that the panning feature will not be able to blend between the two speakers. Both speakers will face the audience and evenly distribute sound throughout the venue. The main output jacks on the mixer are typically **XLR**, so you’ll need the right cables to connect the speakers.

1. Turn each channel’s gain knob and level fader all the way down.
    
2. Connect your main speakers to the mixer’s Main out jacks.
    
    For passive speakers, connect the Main out jacks to the power amplifier inputs. Once done, connect the power amplifier outputs to the speaker inputs.
    
3. Power on the mixer and speakers (or power amplifier).
    
4. Set mixer levels to unity and adjust the speaker output level
    
5. Turn up the Main mix fader level to 0 (unity).
    
6. Play audio through a channel (microphone, guitar, or phone/computer playback). Be sure to set the channel’s gain knob while its level fader is at 0 (unison).
    
7. Turn up each main speaker’s level knob until the volume compliments the venue.
    

#### Step Two: Setting up the Stage Speakers

Stage speakers *(if present)* are slightly different from main speakers because they are placed on the stage and face each performer. What you hear from a stage monitor is almost always different from the mains because what the performer needs to hear to perform is different from what the audience needs to enjoy the performance.

While each channel’s volume level determines the main mix, stage monitor mixes are instead defined by each channel’s Aux Send level. Aux sends can have a few names, but you’ll use Auxiliary (Aux), or Monitor (Mon) sends and outputs for stage monitors. The more you turn up a channel’s Aux or Mon knob, the more you will hear it in the connected stage monitor. Once the monitor mix is created, control how much total level is sent to the speaker, adjusting the mixer’s *(not an individual channel’s)* Aux send level.

1. Turn each stage monitor’s and Mon send’s level all the way down.
    
2. Connect the mixer’s Mon output to the stage monitor and power it on.
    
3. Turn up the mixer’s Mon send level to 0 (unison).
    
4. Play sound through your mixer (microphones, instruments, or phone/computer playback). Turn that channel’s Mon send level 0 (unison).
    
5. Turn up the stage monitor’s level to the desired volume. Once done, adjust each channel’s Mon send to create the monitor mix.
    

#### Step Three: Connecting a Microphone

Once the speakers are connected, the next thing to do is connect the microphones and instruments. Connect each one to a mixer channel and set its *gain* and *mix* levels. The gain knob controls the preamplifier level, and its job is to bring the incoming signal up to line level. An excellent way to set the gain level is by performing the loudest they will play in the performance. You then turn the gain until it clips or triggers the overload (OL) indicator.

This is the maximum gain level you should use for that channel; otherwise, the signal will be overdriven and sound distorted. Without adding enough gain, the signal will be too quiet, and you’ll have to increase the channel level fader to hear it again. This is not optimal and will produce an overall noisier signal. Instead, set the gain level as high as possible before the channel starts clipping. Once you set the gain, use the channel **fader** to balance its level within the main mix.

1. Connect a microphone to Channel 1 with a standard XLR cable.
    
2. Strongly speak 1” from the microphone and turn up the Gain knob until the channel’s Peak/Level Set LED lights up.
    
3. Send the channel to your Main mix by turning up the channel’s Level fader/knob.
    

#### Step Four: Adding Sound Effects

Some mixers have built-in FX that you can use to add reverb, delay, and other effects to your mix. For a channel to receive an effect, you’ll need to send it to the effects bus, which is basically a unique mix created from all the **FX send** levels. The controls will vary from mixer to mixer, but keep in mind that some mixers have additional controls to adjust how much FX bus is sent to the Main and/or Monitor mixes.

1. Set the FX send fader and any FX to Main/Monitor knobs levels to 0 (unity).
    
2. Use the FX encoder to select the desired effect.
    
3. Adjust each channel’s FX Aux send knob to control its level to the FX bus.
    

#### Optional: Connecting an external device

Connecting a phone, tablet, or computer is just like a microphone, but you don’t connect it to a microphone input. Most mixers will have more than one input option, such as Phono or TRS. If your device has a 3.5mm (⅛”) output jack, you can use a stereo RCA or ¼” TRS adapter cable to connect to 2-Track or Line inputs. If your mixer has a USB connection, you can connect it to a computer for playback or recording. Keep in mind that the way you connect the device will determine which level faders you use to adjust its level in the main and monitor mixes.

When connecting to a computer via USB, you must also configure its playback and recording settings. That means installing any necessary drivers and updating the Windows or macOS sound settings. If you record the mix into a DAW, its hardware settings will also need to be updated to select the mixer. If your mixer does not show up on your computer, follow our troubleshooting guides for PC and Mac to get it connected.

Select the connection type, turn down its level control, and then connect your playback device: 2-TRACK: Connect your device to the 2-TRACK phono inputs. 3.5mm &gt; RCA TS &gt; RCA RCA &gt; RCA LINE IN: Connect your device to a channel’s Line in jack (mono) or jacks (stereo) 3.5mm (⅛”) &gt; TRS (mono) or dual TS (stereo) TRS &gt; TRS (mono) or dual TRS &gt; TRS (stereo) RCA &gt; dual TRS (stereo) USB: Connect the mixer to your computer with a USB cable and then select it within your computer’s audio playback/recording settings. Turn the output volume on the playback device all the way up. Send the channel to your Main mix by turning up the channel’s level fader.

So, this was it. I'll be posting additional tips in the comments section. See ya. Love.
